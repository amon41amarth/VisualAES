Questions for Dr. B:
1. Number of rounds in relation to round keys.
2. Can we edit the s box?
3. What exactly do you mean by variable watching?
4. Should the Initialization Vector be editable, or just leave it constant?
5. Keys must be divisible by 16, 24, 32 depending on key size. So should we allow 2K1P?
6. 4X4 only.
